# Home Economics — Analysis Code

This repository contains the scripts, data, and charts behind [Home Economics](https://homeeconomics.substack.com), a data-driven Substack about housing, demographics, and the American economy by Aziz Sunderji.

Every chart and statistic published on Home Economics is backed by real data and reproducible code. This repo is that code.

## Structure

Each project folder typically contains:
- `scripts/` — Python scripts that pull, process, and visualize data
- `outputs/` — Charts (SVG, PNG, HTML) generated by the scripts
- `data/` — Small intermediate datasets (CSVs, JSONs)

Large source datasets (parquet files, shapefiles) are excluded from this repo. The scripts reference data from public sources including the Census Bureau, FRED, BLS, Redfin, Zillow, FHFA, and BEA. Source URLs and API calls are visible in the scripts.

## Data Sources

Most analyses draw from publicly available data:
- **Census Bureau** — ACS, population estimates, migration tables
- **FRED** — Mortgage rates, unemployment, economic indicators
- **Redfin / Zillow** — Housing market data
- **FHFA** — House price indices
- **BEA** — GDP by state and metro
- **BLS** — Employment, time use (ATUS)
- **IPUMS** — CPS and ATUS microdata
